        I first encountered the GNU Project in 1991 when another Swedish-speaking computer science student, Lars Wirzenius, took me to the University of Technology to listen to free software guru Richard Stallman's speech. I used Stallman's GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) for my Linux kernel. </aboutbody>

        In June 2004, his family and I moved to Dunthorpe, Oregon to be closer to the OSDL's headquarters in Beaverton. From 1997 to 1999, I was involved in 86open, helping select the standard binary format for Linux and Unix. In 1999, I was named by the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the world's top 100 innovators under age 35.</aboutbody>

        In 1999, Red Hat and VA Linux, both leading developers of Linux-based software, presented me with stock options in gratitude for my creation. That year both companies went public and my share value briefly shot up to about US$20 million.</aboutbody>

        My personal mascot is a penguin nicknamed Tux, which has been widely adopted by the Linux community as the Linux kernel's mascot.</aboutbody>

        Although I believe "open source is the only right way to do software", I have also said that I use the "best tool for the job", even if that includes proprietary software. I was criticized for my use and alleged advocacy of the proprietary BitKeeper software for version control in the Linux kernel. I subsequently wrote a free-software replacement for it called Git. The Linux Foundation currently sponsors me so I can work full-time on improving Linux.</aboutbody>
